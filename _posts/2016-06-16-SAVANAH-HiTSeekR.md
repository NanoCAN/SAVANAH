SAVANAH is now integrated with HiTSeekR (List et al. 2016, http://hitseekr.compbio.sdu.dk). 
HiTSeekR is a web application for the comprehensive analysis of high-throughput screening data. 
It provides extensive support for raw data processing, hit discovery and 
systems biomedicine analysis for various screen types, including RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9, miRNA and 
small compound screens. To use HiTSeekR using SAVANAH as starting point follow these instructions 
(also found in the user manual). 
- Press on the Analysis button in the navigation bar
- Optionally filter for a project, an experiment or a specific plate layout 
- Select plates you want to include in the analysis,
- Select a screen type (siRNA for screens targeting genes, miRNA or compound)
- Click on the HiTSeekR logo

Alternatively, data can still be analyzed directly in R by clicking on the R logo in the last step.
